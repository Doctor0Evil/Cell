          Player’s spoken line is swallowed by the ductwork; a flat,
          dead reverb hangs for a moment. After half a second, the
          same words return from the vent, thinner, with an extra,
          damp breath braided under the syllables. UI desaturates
          slightly; oxygen warnings flicker, then pretend nothing
          happened.

        description: >
          A low, band-limited hiss rises behind the grill like a
          detuned radio hunting for a station. The signal stretches
          into metal panting, each exhale scraping along the ducts.
          Somewhere in the cargo maze, a Growler answers with a
          strangled half-bark, half-sob that clips as if the ship
          itself cut the feed.

        description: >
          Corridor signs on bulkheads jitter, briefly pointing in
          wrong directions before realigning. Map markers glitch, then
          snap to new paths. On the motion tracker, a loose scatter of
          contacts turns as one, angling toward the player’s deck.
          Taboo tooltip updates itself: 'The vents remember routes.'
