# PROJECT BOUNDARY — Cell (PC Horror Game)

Cell is a standalone, traditional PC horror game.

## Hard rules

- Do NOT introduce:
  - AU.ET or CSP concepts
  - BCI, EEG, neuromorphic, or ALN schemas
  - JavaSpectre VNodes, SessionTickets, or CEM/CyberCore ledgers
- Keep all integrations limited to:
  - Standard game engines (e.g., Unity, Unreal, custom C++/C# engine)
  - Traditional tooling (build systems, asset pipelines, patchers, crash reporting, etc.)

## AI assistant guidance

AI assistants:
- Focus on horror gameplay, maps, assets, performance, and standard PC tooling.
- Do NOT reference JavaSpectre or CyberCore/CEM types, protocols, or ledgers.
- Treat Cell as completely independent from any browser intelligence or cybernetic runtime.
