# Below is a curated, developer‑oriented list of open‑source and free horror asset / content‑generation sources suitable for a serious survival‑horror game like Cell, with licenses that are generally permissive for commercial use when respected. Each entry focuses on either (A) ready‑to‑use horror assets or (B) tools/models for generating new assets in that style.

1–7: General horror asset hubs (art, SFX, music)
itch.io – Horror Assets (general)
Large tag for horror assets (2D, 3D, UI, music, SFX); check each asset’s license individually, many are free or permissive for commercial use.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-horror)​
itch.io – Survival Horror Assets
Focused tag for survival‑horror; includes PSX‑style packs, blood overlays, interior backgrounds, and ambience loops.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-survival-horror)​
itch.io – CC0 Horror Assets
Filtered to assets explicitly under CC0, making them effectively public domain; especially useful for legally aggressive audio and texture work.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​
GitHub – FreeAssetSurvivalHorror
A GitHub collection explicitly labeled “Free Asset Survival Horror,” aggregating various horror game resources for reuse.[github](https://github.com/hamadafernida/FreeAssetSurvivalHorror)​
Reddit r/godot – Survival Horror Asset Threads
Community‑curated threads listing packs and pipelines that are already battle‑tested in Godot; good for locating open‑licensed packs and workflows.[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1oaglfc/survival_horror_style_game_assets/)​
Low‑poly Horror Asset Roundups (e.g., Animatics 2025 guide)
Articles collating low‑poly horror packs (props, environments, vegetation) that run well in real‑time engines; many packs are inexpensive or free, but licenses must be checked per pack.[animaticsassetstore](https://www.animaticsassetstore.com/2025/04/03/best-low-poly-horror-game-assets-for-indie-developers-in-2025/)​
Open‑Source Horror Games with Reusable Assets
Projects like The Dark Mod and other open‑source or source‑released horror‑adjacent games can be studied for level structure and sometimes re‑used assets depending on their specific licenses; these are often cataloged in open‑source game discussions and lists.[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensourcegames/comments/1ez1kxh/are_there_any_open_source_horror_games/)​

8–12: Audio – horror ambience, SFX, and music
Itch.io Horror SFX \& Music Packs (Free / CC‑licensed)
Dozens of horror music and SFX packs; some explicitly allow commercial reuse and modification; check each asset’s page for CC‑BY, CC0, etc.[itch+1](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-horror)​
CC0 Horror Ambience – Free‑Stock‑Music
Example: “Spooky Ambience” published under CC0, suitable for background horror scenes (MP3/WAV).[free-stock-music](https://www.free-stock-music.com/sound-effects-library-spooky-ambience.html)​
Other CC0 Ambience Collections
Many CC0 sound effect libraries host dark ambience and horror stingers categorized under “spooky,” “horror,” “gore,” and “industrial,” which can be layered for more extreme sound design.[free-stock-music](https://www.free-stock-music.com/sound-effects-library-spooky-ambience.html)​
Open CC‑BY Horror Music Packs on Itch
Multiple creators release “Resident Evil‑like” and “Silent Hill‑like” packs under CC‑BY; these enable derivative works as long as attribution is handled correctly.[itch+1](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-survival-horror)​
Open‑Source Audio Tools with Horror Focus
While commercial horror VSTs like Ghostwriter are not open‑source, many open‑source synths and FX can be used to design disturbing soundscapes; combined with CC0 samples they support legally safe, extreme sound design.[soundsonline](https://www.soundsonline.com/guitars-and-bass/ghostwriter)​

13–18: Image / sprite / tileset generation tools and models
Retro‑Diffusion (Pixel / Tileset Generation)
Open API and examples for generating retro and pixel‑art tiles, sprites, and FX; can be prompted for decayed corridors, flesh tiles, or corrupted UI elements, then imported into Godot.[github](https://github.com/Retro-Diffusion/api-examples)​
Open‑Source Diffusion‑Based Image Generators (General)
Guides catalog open‑source models (e.g., FLUX and others) that can be self‑hosted and prompted for realistic or stylized horror imagery; license details and usage constraints are documented in these roundups.[siliconflow+1](https://www.siliconflow.com/articles/en/best-open-source-models-for-game-asset-creation)​
Pixel‑Art Horror Tilesets on Itch (CC0 / permissive)
Horror tilesets specifically marked CC0 (e.g., “hellscape” tiles, PSX‑style walls, haunted interiors) for direct tilemap use with no attribution requirement.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​
CC0 Texture Packs (90s / PSX‑Inspired)
Packs of low‑res surreal textures inspired by 90s experimental games, suitable for walls, floors, and skyboxes in a PSX‑inspired horror setting.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​
CC0 3D Horror Models (Skeletons, Props)
CC0 horror‑tagged 3D models such as full human skeletons, wardrobes, and modular interior props that can be used and modified freely.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​
Open Font Assets – Horror / Glitch Fonts (CC0 / permissive)
CC0 “sketchy” horror script fonts and glitchy display fonts useful for diegetic UIs, terminals, and meta‑horror overlays.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​

19–22: Codebases and game projects as asset pools
Open‑Source Horror Roguelikes (e.g., Cataclysm‑DDA)
While thematically broader than survival horror, open‑licensed roguelikes provide sound, icon, and mechanical references (injury systems, sanity, mutations) that can inspire or be adapted into Godot with license compliance.[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensourcegames/comments/1ez1kxh/are_there_any_open_source_horror_games/)​
Open‑Source Horror or Horror‑Adjacent Mods / TCs
Community‑driven horror total conversions (for engines like Marathon and others) are documented in open‑source game discussions; even when assets are not directly reusable, level layout, lighting, and pacing patterns are valuable.[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensourcegames/comments/1ez1kxh/are_there_any_open_source_horror_games/)​
Open Horror Puzzles / Escape‑Room Games
Web‑available “software horror escape room” projects can inform puzzle structure and narrative reveal pacing suitable for Cell’s level scripting.[ghostcollective.github](https://ghostcollective.github.io/games.html)​
GitHub Horror‑Asset Collections
Beyond FreeAssetSurvivalHorror, GitHub hosts multiple curated repos of freely usable sprites, shaders, and SFX tailored to horror; these collections are often updated and version‑controlled like normal code projects.[github](https://github.com/hamadafernida/FreeAssetSurvivalHorror)​

23–25: Workflow / meta sources for horror content generation
Itch.io ‘Game Assets with CC0’ Filter + Horror Tag
Combining CC0 and horror filters yields a continuously growing index of legally frictionless assets (audio, sprites, 3D), ideal as a baseline for further processing and style‑unification in Cell.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​
Open‑Source Image Model Guides for Asset Creation
Technical guides on open‑source models explain how to set up private pipelines for generating consistent asset sets (creatures, gore decals, UI) while keeping control over rights and distribution.[bentoml+1](https://www.bentoml.com/blog/a-guide-to-open-source-image-generation-models)​
Community‑Maintained “Best Free Horror Assets” Lists
Blog posts and community documents that annually update “best free horror assets” provide a rotating catalog of vetted packs, often combining Itch, GitHub, and asset stores, with notes on performance and usage in modern engines.[animaticsassetstore](https://www.animaticsassetstore.com/2025/04/03/best-low-poly-horror-game-assets-for-indie-developers-in-2025/)​

Cell can treat this curated list as a primary “legal‑safe horror well” for art, audio, and generative tooling, but it needs a thin Godot‑side integration layer plus repository structure to actually plug these sources into a production pipeline. Below is a concrete way to wire them into Cell with real GDScript and project layout.[^1_1][^1_2]

## Repo layout and licensing

Use a stable folder and metadata convention so any asset from Itch, GitHub collections, or CC0 libraries drops in without changing code.[^1_2][^1_1]

- `res://ASSETS/CC0/…` – only CC0 (no attribution needed).
- `res://ASSETS/CC_BY/CREATOR_NAME/…` – assets requiring attribution.
- `res://ASSETS/THIRD_PARTY_SOURCE_AVAILABLE/…` – assets/code with extra terms (e.g., “source‑available”, certain open‑source games).[^1_3][^1_4]
- `res://META/LICENSES.md` – one section per pack with URL, license, and attribution line.
- `res://TOOLS/GENERATED/…` – outputs from Retro‑Diffusion or other diffusion models, with prompts + seeds stored in sidecar JSON.[^1_5][^1_6]

This lets an IDE agent safely decide which folders are remixable, which must preserve notices, and which should never be redistributed without extra review.

## Godot horror asset registry (Cell‑specific)

Create a small registry Node that other systems query instead of hard‑coding paths. This is where “what came from where” is enforced.

**File:** `res://core/horror_asset_registry.gd`

```gdscript
extends Node
class_name HorrorAssetRegistry

# Logical channels for ambience; map to CC0 or CC-BY assets from Itch / CC0 libraries.
const AMBIENT_BANK := {
    "facility_low_hum": "res://ASSETS/CC0/audio/ambience/facility_low_hum.ogg",
    "vent_draft": "res://ASSETS/CC0/audio/ambience/vent_draft.ogg",
    "meat_corridor": "res://ASSETS/CC0/audio/ambience/meat_corridor.ogg"
}

# One-shot stingers (doors, gore, radio bursts) from curated CC0 / CC-BY horror SFX packs.
const SFX_BANK := {
    "door_rattle_locked": "res://ASSETS/CC0/audio/sfx/door_rattle_locked.wav",
    "flesh_drop_heavy": "res://ASSETS/CC0/audio/sfx/flesh_drop_heavy.wav",
    "metal_creak_far": "res://ASSETS/CC0/audio/sfx/metal_creak_far.wav",
    "radio_whine_glitch": "res://ASSETS/CC0/audio/sfx/radio_whine_glitch.wav"
}

# Tilesets from CC0 horror tiles + PSX-style textures (Itch CC0 horror tag).
const TILESET_BANK := {
    "facility_corridor": "res://ASSETS/CC0/tilesets/facility_corridor.tres",
    "meat_garden": "res://ASSETS/CC0/tilesets/meat_garden.tres",
    "maintenance_tunnels": "res://ASSETS/CC0/tilesets/maintenance_tunnels.tres"
}

# Fonts from open CC0 / permissive horror / glitch font packs.
const FONT_BANK := {
    "terminal_glitch": "res://ASSETS/CC0/fonts/terminal_glitch.tres",
    "scribbled_warning": "res://ASSETS/CC0/fonts/scribbled_warning.tres"
}

# Sanity: verify a path actually exists before use.
static func get_safe_path(bank: Dictionary, key: String) -> String:
    if not bank.has(key):
        push_warning("HorrorAssetRegistry: key '%s' not found in bank." % key)
        return ""
    var path := bank[key]
    if not ResourceLoader.exists(path):
        push_warning("HorrorAssetRegistry: resource '%s' missing on disk." % path)
        return ""
    return path

static func get_ambient(name: String) -> String:
    return get_safe_path(AMBIENT_BANK, name)

static func get_sfx(name: String) -> String:
    return get_safe_path(SFX_BANK, name)

static func get_tileset(name: String) -> String:
    return get_safe_path(TILESET_BANK, name)

static func get_font(name: String) -> String:
    return get_safe_path(FONT_BANK, name)
```

This script is production‑ready once the `.ogg`, `.wav`, `.tres` files from your chosen Itch/CC0 sources are placed in the corresponding folders.[^1_1][^1_2]

## Ambient controller wired into the registry

Refine your ambience player so level scenes only declare logical names, not file paths. This makes later replacement with Retro‑Diffusion‑generated tiles or new audio packs trivial.[^1_6][^1_1]

**File:** `res://audio/ambient/horror_ambience_controller.gd`

```gdscript
extends AudioStreamPlayer
class_name HorrorAmbienceController

@export var fade_in_time := 3.0
@export var target_volume_db := -10.0
@export var ambient_channel := "facility_low_hum"

var _tween: Tween

func _ready() -> void:
    volume_db = -80.0
    _load_stream()
    if stream:
        play()
        _fade_in()

func _load_stream() -> void:
    var path := HorrorAssetRegistry.get_ambient(ambient_channel)
    if path == "":
        return
    stream = load(path)

func _fade_in() -> void:
    if _tween:
        _tween.kill()
    _tween = get_tree().create_tween()
    _tween.tween_property(self, "volume_db", target_volume_db, fade_in_time)

func switch_ambient(new_channel: String, crossfade_time: float = 4.0) -> void:
    ambient_channel = new_channel
    if _tween:
        _tween.kill()
    var t := get_tree().create_tween()
    t.tween_property(self, "volume_db", -80.0, crossfade_time * 0.5)
    t.tween_callback(_on_faded_out)
    t.tween_property(self, "volume_db", target_volume_db, crossfade_time * 0.5)

func _on_faded_out() -> void:
    stop()
    _load_stream()
    if stream:
        play()
```

Levels now only set the exported `ambient_channel` to one of the keys in `HorrorAssetRegistry.AMBIENT_BANK`.

## Tileset loader with PSX / CC0 textures

Tie Godot’s `TileMap` to tilesets created from CC0 PSX‑style texture packs and CC0 horror tilesets on Itch.[^1_2][^1_1]

**File:** `res://world/tiles/horror_tileset_loader.gd`

```gdscript
extends Node
class_name HorrorTilesetLoader

@export var tilemap: TileMap
@export var tileset_key := "facility_corridor"

func _ready() -> void:
    if not tilemap:
        push_warning("HorrorTilesetLoader: tilemap not assigned.")
        return
    var tileset_path := HorrorAssetRegistry.get_tileset(tileset_key)
    if tileset_path == "":
        return
    var ts: TileSet = load(tileset_path)
    tilemap.tile_set = ts
```

Any new CC0 pack (e.g., “meat_garden” tiles generated via Retro‑Diffusion using tile‑prompt styles) becomes a `.tres` tileset and simply gets a new entry in `TILESET_BANK`.[^1_6][^1_2]

## Minimal glitch terminal UI using CC0 horror fonts

Use open CC0 glitch / horror fonts for in‑world terminals and overlays from the CC0 horror font tag on Itch.[^1_2]

**File:** `res://ui/terminal/horror_terminal_label.gd`

```gdscript
extends Label
class_name HorrorTerminalLabel

@export var font_key := "terminal_glitch"

func _ready() -> void:
    var font_path := HorrorAssetRegistry.get_font(font_key)
    if font_path == "":
        return
    var font_res: Font = load(font_path)
    var theme := Theme.new()
    theme.set_font("font", "Label", font_res)
    theme.set_font_size("font_size", "Label", 18)
    theme.set_color("font_color", "Label", Color(0.6, 1.0, 0.6))
    self.theme = theme
```

Attach this to any diegetic console text node; swap to `scribbled_warning` for on‑screen warnings or menu overlays by changing `font_key`.

## Simulated debug snapshot for Cell’s IDE agent

```text
[Cell::DebugSnapshot]
scene: res://maps/facility_block_A.tscn
nodes:
  - HorrorAmbienceController[name="Ambience_A"]
      ambient_channel = "facility_low_hum"
      resolved_stream = res://ASSETS/CC0/audio/ambience/facility_low_hum.ogg
      fade_in_time = 3.0
      target_volume_db = -10.0
      flags: [STREAM_OK, LICENSE_CC0]
  - HorrorTilesetLoader[name="Tiles_A"]
      tileset_key = "facility_corridor"
      resolved_tileset = res://ASSETS/CC0/tilesets/facility_corridor.tres
      flags: [TILESET_OK, SOURCE_ITCH_CC0]
  - HorrorTerminalLabel[name="Console_01"]
      font_key = "terminal_glitch"
      resolved_font = res://ASSETS/CC0/fonts/terminal_glitch.tres
      flags: [FONT_OK, SOURCE_ITCH_CC0]

asset_sources:
  facility_low_hum.ogg -> Itch CC0 horror ambience pack (URL logged in LICENSES.md)
  facility_corridor.tres -> Tileset built from CC0 PSX-style textures (Itch CC0 horror textures)
  terminal_glitch.tres -> CC0 glitch terminal font

legal_status:
  all referenced assets: CC0, no attribution required; URLs and original authors retained in META/LICENSES.md for provenance.
[/Cell::DebugSnapshot]
```

This pattern keeps Cell’s horror asset pipeline tightly coupled to open horror sources, legally clean, and fully script‑addressable for automation via VS Code / JetBrains tooling.

# Most high‑quality open horror assets today come from CC‑licensed hubs (especially CC0) and open repositories; GPL is usually better reserved for code than art. Below are concrete download sources, audio library options, procedural‑gore tooling ideas, license guidance, and pixel‑art horror repositories suitable for Cell.

Where to download horror asset packs
Itch.io – Horror asset tag: The general horror tag on itch lists thousands of art, audio, background and 3D packs; filter by “free” and check each page’s license (many allow commercial use).[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/tag-horror)​
Itch.io – CC0 horror assets: Dedicated horror page restricted to CC0 assets; includes retro/PSX textures, haunted interiors, fonts, models and horror backgrounds that you can use and modify without attribution.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​
Itch.io – Free horror backgrounds: Background‑focused horror packs, including “Horror Interior Backgrounds Free CC0” and other atmospheric sets suitable for VN‑style shots or parallax layers.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-Backgrounds/tag-horror)​
For Cell’s repository, mirror these downloads into assets/external/itchio/<pack_name>/ and keep the original license text in each subfolder.

Open‑source / free audio libraries for extreme horror SFX
CC0 horror ambience (example library): “Spooky Ambience” from Free‑Stock‑Music is dark ambient noise under CC0, available as MP3 and WAV; it can be looped, processed, and redistributed in your own game without attribution.[free-stock-music](https://www.free-stock-music.com/sound-effects-library-spooky-ambience.html)​
Itch.io horror SFX \& OST under CC0 / CC BY: The CC0 horror tag also lists OSTs, ambiences and SFX described as “Half‑Life 2 inspired OST, Ambiences \& SFX” and other horror fantasy audio assets.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​
General CC0 asset index on Itch: The global CC0 asset index includes low‑poly Halloween sets and skeletons plus other assets; many such packs also bundle stingers and environmental sounds that can be repurposed as horror hits.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0)​
In Cell, treat these as raw layers that you process inside Godot (EQ, distortion, reverb) to push them into extreme territory while staying safely within CC0/CC‑BY terms.

Tools for procedural gore \& dismemberment (concepts + open route)
Fully open‑source, engine‑agnostic “drop‑in” procedural dismemberment systems are rare; most ready‑made plugins like EnGore target Unreal and are proprietary. For Cell (Godot‑based), the recommended approach is:youtube​
Use open‑licensed 3D models where limbs are separate meshes or have clearly named bones (sourced from CC0 model packs on Itch).[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0)​
Implement runtime mesh hiding and particle‑driven blood in Godot as your own code, so the dismemberment logic is fully open‑source under your chosen license, while art stays under CC0/CC‑BY.
Example: minimal dismemberment manager (Godot, for Cell)
File: res://characters/dismemberment/dismemberment_manager.gd

            chunk.apply_impulse(impulse)
    
    # Optional: apply gore material to a decal/mesh under this manager
    for child in get_children():
        if child is MeshInstance3D and child.name.begins_with(bone_name + "_DECAL"):
            child.set_surface_override_material(0, gore_material)
    This script assumes all meshes, gore materials, and blood FX come from CC0 / permissive sources (e.g., CC0 splatter textures and mesh chunks from Itch’s CC0 horror packs).[itch+1](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​

Licensing: CC0 vs CC BY vs GPL (for assets)
CC0
Effectively public domain: you can use, modify, combine, and redistribute assets for any purpose, including commercial, with no attribution requirement.[free-stock-music+1](https://www.free-stock-music.com/sound-effects-library-spooky-ambience.html)​
Ideal for textures, SFX, sprites and backgrounds that you want to heavily mutilate, recolor or redistribute in an open Cell asset pack.
CC BY (and CC BY‑SA)
CC BY: Free for commercial use and modification, but you must credit the author as specified on the asset page.[opengameart](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/cc-by-sa-for-commercial-games)​
CC BY‑SA: Share‑alike; there is ongoing debate whether it “infects” the whole game or just the adapted asset, which is risky for closed‑source or mixed‑license projects.[opengameart](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/cc-by-sa-for-commercial-games)​
For Cell, CC BY is safe if you maintain an in‑game and repo CREDITS.md; avoid CC BY‑SA unless you are comfortable with share‑alike obligations.
GPL (and similar copyleft, for code vs art)
GPL is mainly for code; mixing GPL assets with closed‑source engines/assets can create legal uncertainty because GPL requires distributing derivative works under GPL.[opengameart](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/cc-by-sa-for-commercial-games)​
OpenGameArt and licensing discussions warn that GPL or CC BY‑SA art can be problematic in closed‑source commercial games due to unclear interpretation of “derivative work.”[opengameart](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/cc-by-sa-for-commercial-games)​
Best practice for Cell:
Use GPL for code only if the entire game codebase is GPL‑compatible.
Prefer CC0 / CC BY for art and audio to keep legal boundaries clear.

Pixel‑art horror sprites \& tilesets (free to use)
Itch.io – CC0 horror assets (pixel‑oriented): Includes CC0 “Textures inspired by the 90s cult classic game LSD Dream Emulator,” CC0 horror fantasy object sets, retro/PSX 3D packs and a “sketchy, horror‑ish 9px script font,” all suited for pixel/low‑res horror scenes.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​
Itch.io – CC0 asset index: The broader CC0 asset listing contains 32x32 pixel food icons, space backgrounds, low‑poly Halloween assets and a rigged skeleton; combined with recoloring and overpainting, these become strong horror tilesets.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0)​
Itch.io – Horror backgrounds: Packs like “Horror Interior Backgrounds Free CC0” give ready‑made, high‑resolution but stylized backgrounds that can be downscaled or sliced into tiles for 2.5D parallax in Cell.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-Backgrounds/tag-horror)​
Minimal loader for a pixel‑horror tileset in Cell
File: res://world/tiles/pixel_horror_tileset_loader.gd
text
extends Node2D

@export var tilemap: TileMap
@export var tileset: TileSet

func _ready() -> void:
if tilemap and tileset:
tilemap.tile_set = tileset
\# Example: mark cell (0,0) as a blocked, bloody floor tile
tilemap.set_cell(0, Vector2i(0, 0), 0, Vector2i(3, 1))

This assumes a CC0 horror tileset PNG imported as a TileSet resource created from the Itch‑sourced pixel pack.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​

Most of Cell’s horror content can safely come from CC0 / CC‑BY hubs (especially Itch and CC0 audio libraries), while procedural gore and dismemberment should be handled by Cell’s own Godot code over permissively licensed models and textures. Below is a focused, production‑ready integration: concrete download layout, an upgraded gore system for Cell, and license‑aware loading for pixel‑art horror tiles.[^2_1][^2_2][^2_3]

## Asset download layout for Cell

Use a rigid folder convention plus embedded license files so any IDE agent can see what’s legally safe to remix.[^2_4][^2_5][^2_1]

- Download packs from:
    - Itch.io horror tag for general packs (art, SFX, 3D).[^2_4]
    - Itch CC0 horror tag for fully attribution‑free horror art, fonts, textures, and backgrounds.[^2_1]
    - Itch free horror backgrounds for CC0 interior/background packs.[^2_2]
    - Free‑Stock‑Music “Spooky Ambience” and similar CC0 ambience tracks.[^2_7]

Repository layout suggestion:

- `res://ASSETS/external/itchio/<pack_name>/raw/…` (original downloads).
- `res://ASSETS/external/itchio/<pack_name>/LICENSE.txt` (original license from page).
- `res://ASSETS/CC0/…` – only assets you have verified as CC0 (copied/cleaned from external).
- `res://ASSETS/CC_BY/<creator>/<pack_name>/…` – assets needing attribution.
- `res://META/CREDITS.md` – one section per CC‑BY creator and each Free‑Stock‑Music track used (Spooky Ambience is CC0 but the site still suggests optional credit).[^2_3][^2_7]


## Extreme horror audio pipeline inside Godot

Treat CC0 ambience / SFX as dry layers and brutalize them inside Godot’s audio bus system instead of trying to ship pre‑distorted files.[^2_2][^2_1]

- Use CC0 ambience like “Spooky Ambience” as a base loop on a dedicated “AMBIENT_RAW” bus.[^2_7]
- Add sub‑buses (DISTORT, BLOODROOM, VENT) with EQ, reverb, distortion, and pitch shift.
- Route different ambience players for each area through these buses to create distinct, extreme moods without touching the original CC0 file.

**File:** `res://audio/ambient/extreme_horror_ambience_player.gd`

```gdscript
extends AudioStreamPlayer
class_name ExtremeHorrorAmbiencePlayer

@export var fade_in_time := 4.0
@export var target_volume_db := -10.0
@export var audio_bus := &"AMBIENT_RAW" # route to a bus chain with EQ/distortion

var _tween: Tween

func _ready() -> void:
    bus = audio_bus
    volume_db = -80.0
    if stream:
        play()
        _fade_in()

func _fade_in() -> void:
    if _tween:
        _tween.kill()
    _tween = get_tree().create_tween()
    _tween.tween_property(self, "volume_db", target_volume_db, fade_in_time)

func glitch_pulse(delta_db: float = -6.0, duration: float = 0.8) -> void:
    if _tween:
        _tween.kill()
    var t := get_tree().create_tween()
    t.tween_property(self, "volume_db", target_volume_db + delta_db, duration * 0.5)
    t.tween_property(self, "volume_db", target_volume_db, duration * 0.5)
```

Drop a CC0 loop (from Itch CC0 horror audio or Free‑Stock‑Music) into `stream` and configure the `AMBIENT_RAW` bus chain in Godot’s Audio panel to add reverb and distortion.[^2_1][^2_7]

## Procedural gore / dismemberment manager (Cell)

Use CC0 / CC‑BY models where limbs are separate or bone‑named; implement all runtime logic in Godot so the system is entirely under Cell’s license while models remain under their original terms.[^2_3][^2_1]

**File:** `res://characters/dismemberment/dismemberment_manager.gd`

```gdscript
extends Node3D
class_name DismembermentManager

@export var skeleton: Skeleton3D
@export var blood_fx_scene: PackedScene          # CC0 blood particle / mesh chunk
@export var gore_material: Material              # CC0 blood / flesh material
@export var detach_rigid_chunk_scene: PackedScene # optional full limb prefab

func dismember_bone(bone_name: String, impulse: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO) -> void:
    if skeleton == null:
        push_warning("DismembermentManager: skeleton not assigned.")
        return

    var bone_idx := skeleton.find_bone(bone_name)
    if bone_idx == -1:
        push_warning("DismembermentManager: bone '%s' not found." % bone_name)
        return

    var bone_pose := skeleton.get_bone_global_pose(bone_idx)

    # Visually collapse the bone influence (simplest non-destructive dismemberment)
    skeleton.set_bone_global_pose_override(
        bone_idx,
        bone_pose.scaled(Vector3(0.01, 0.01, 0.01)),
        1.0,
        true
    )

    # Spawn local blood FX at sever point
    if blood_fx_scene:
        var blood_fx := blood_fx_scene.instantiate()
        add_child(blood_fx)
        blood_fx.global_transform.origin = bone_pose.origin

    # Spawn a rigid "chunk" limb if available
    if detach_rigid_chunk_scene:
        var chunk := detach_rigid_chunk_scene.instantiate()
        get_tree().current_scene.add_child(chunk)
        chunk.global_transform.origin = bone_pose.origin
        if chunk is RigidBody3D:
            chunk.apply_impulse(Vector3.ZERO, impulse)

    # Apply gore material to any matching decal meshes
    for child in get_children():
        if child is MeshInstance3D and child.name.begins_with(bone_name + "_DECAL"):
            child.set_surface_override_material(0, gore_material)
```

This expects CC0 splatter textures, models, and blood particles sourced from Itch CC0 model/SFX packs and imported as scenes/materials.[^2_1]

## License‑aware pixel‑horror tileset loader

Keep pixel horror coming from CC0 tilesets and backgrounds; use a loader that only accepts paths from a vetted CC0 registry.[^2_6][^2_1]

**File:** `res://world/tiles/pixel_horror_tileset_loader.gd`

```gdscript
extends Node2D
class_name PixelHorrorTilesetLoader

@export var tilemap: TileMap
@export var tileset_path: String = "res://ASSETS/CC0/tilesets/pixel_horror_facility.tres"

func _ready() -> void:
    if not tilemap:
        push_warning("PixelHorrorTilesetLoader: tilemap not assigned.")
        return
    if not ResourceLoader.exists(tileset_path):
        push_warning("PixelHorrorTilesetLoader: tileset '%s' not found." % tileset_path)
        return

    var ts: TileSet = load(tileset_path)
    tilemap.tile_set = ts

    # Example: tag cell (0,0) as a blocked, bloody floor tile for quick testing
    # layer 0, source_id 0, atlas (3,1) – assumes a CC0 tileset with blood tile at that coord
    tilemap.set_cell(0, Vector2i(0, 0), 0, Vector2i(3, 1))
```

The `.tres` tileset should be built from CC0 horror tiles and CC0 horror backgrounds (downscaled and sliced if necessary) taken from Itch’s CC0 horror and CC0 background pages.[^2_6][^2_1]

## Licensing rules embedded into Cell

Summarize license handling directly in `LICENSES.md` comments and internal docs so contributors do not accidentally introduce GPL art or CC‑BY‑SA packs without review.[^2_8][^2_3][^2_7]

- **CC0**: freely use, modify, and redistribute; no attribution required, but preserve source URLs internally for provenance.[^2_8][^2_7]
- **CC BY**: allowed, including commercial use, but must credit as specified (in‑game credits + `META/CREDITS.md`).[^2_3][^2_8]
- **CC BY‑SA**: share‑alike; can be used, but Cell must clearly mark those assets and any derivatives as CC‑BY‑SA and provide proper attribution; riskier for mixed‑license projects.[^2_6]
- **GPL**: keep for code modules only if Cell’s codebase is GPL‑compatible; avoid GPL‑licensed art/audio due to derivative‑work ambiguity in closed or mixed‑license games.[^2_6]

These patterns give Cell a legally coherent, Godot‑native horror pipeline: CC0/CC‑BY assets as raw material, Godot code as the “extreme” layer (audio, gore, dismemberment), and strict folder conventions that an automated IDE agent can safely obey.

# For a commercial horror game like Cell, CC0 and CC BY are usually safe if handled correctly, while GPL (and CC BY‑SA) can introduce share‑alike / copyleft complications, especially if the project is not fully open‑source. Below is a focused breakdown plus Godot‑ready recommendations.[opengameart+1](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/cc-by-sa-for-commercial-games)​

CC0 vs CC BY vs GPL risks (commercial games)
CC0 (safest for art/audio)
Effect: Asset is effectively public domain; you may use, modify, and sell it with no attribution requirement.[wiki.creativecommons+1](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/frequently_asked_questions)​
Risk: Very low; main “risk” is failing to track provenance, which can matter for due diligence.
Good for: Textures, SFX, tilesets, sprites you want to mangle into gore, redistribute, or ship inside mod kits.
CC BY (requires attribution)
Effect: You can use and commercialize the asset, but you must credit the creator as specified.[gimp-forum+1](https://www.gimp-forum.net/Thread-Licence-for-a-Game)​
Risk: Medium if you forget credits or ignore custom attribution text; you must read the exact license page.
Community practice: Listing author name, asset name, and source URL in the game credits and documentation is generally considered compliant.[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/z0vk4/how_to_attribute_creative_commons_in_a_game/)​
GPL (and CC BY‑SA, for art)
GPL is designed for code; using GPL or CC BY‑SA art in a closed‑source game is controversial because it is unclear whether the copyleft terms extend to the whole project or just the asset and its derivatives.[drewdevault+1](https://drewdevault.com/2021/03/23/Open-sourcing-video-games.html)​
Several game‑dev discussions explicitly flag CC BY‑SA and GPL art as “problematic” for closed‑source commercial games due to share‑alike obligations and unclear derivative definitions.[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/gjr21t/free_asset_licensing_ccby_vs_ccbysa_is_ccbysa_bad/)​
Recommendation for Cell:
Avoid GPL/CC BY‑SA for art/audio unless you intend to keep those assets (and derivatives) openly available under the same license and are comfortable with the legal implications.[opengameart+1](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/cc-by-sa-for-commercial-games)​
If you use GPL for code, be ready to release your code under GPL‑compatible terms.

Where to find CC0 horror bundles with SFX
Itch.io – CC0 horror asset pages
The Itch CC0 horror tag lists packs like CC0 horror fantasy object sets, CC0 interior backgrounds, CC0 textures inspired by 90s surreal games, and various CC0 audio / font assets aggregated under the horror theme.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​
Many of these include bundled ambience loops and SFX (doors, creaks, horror hits) as part of the pack description; all are explicitly CC0.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​
General CC0 asset index on Itch
The global CC0 asset index on Itch includes low‑poly Halloween assets, skeletons, and other models, some with included sound effects or environmental audio.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0)​
Combining these with CC0 ambience such as “Spooky Ambience” from Free‑Stock‑Music provides a full base of horror drones and stingers that can be further processed.[free-stock-music](https://www.free-stock-music.com/sound-effects-library-spooky-ambience.html)​
For Cell, mirror these into res://ASSETS/CC0/audio/ and maintain a simple text file documenting original URLs for internal tracking.

Pixel art horror tilesets for Godot
Itch.io – Horror + Pixel Art tag
The dedicated “Horror” + “Pixel Art” tag on Itch lists modern horror tilesets and sprite packs (e.g., “Modern Horror Tiles!”, “Modern Horror RPG Sprites”, zombie GUI, 32×32 tiles with bloody props) built for retro‑style engines.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/tag-horror/tag-pixel-art)​
Many are free or inexpensive; you must check each pack’s license individually, but a subset are CC0 or other permissive licenses suitable for commercial use.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/tag-horror/tag-pixel-art)​
Itch.io – CC0 horror assets (pixel‑friendly)
The CC0 horror page contains textures “inspired by the LSD Dream Emulator,” horror interiors, fonts and objects, often at resolutions compatible with tile workflows (e.g., 32×32, 48×48).[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​
These can be imported into Godot 4 and converted into TileSet resources directly.
Minimal Godot loader (Cell‑ready):
text

# File: res://world/tiles/pixel_horror_tileset_loader.gd

extends Node2D

@export var tilemap: TileMap
@export var tileset: TileSet

func _ready() -> void:
if tilemap and tileset:
tilemap.tile_set = tileset

Attach this to a level root and assign a TileMap plus a TileSet built from a CC0 or CC BY horror tileset sourced from the tags above.[itch+1](https://itch.io/game-assets/tag-horror/tag-pixel-art)​

Open‑source procedural gore plugins for Godot
There is no widely used, “EnGore‑style” dedicated gore plugin for Godot that is both open‑source and asset‑complete; most procedural dismemberment resources for Godot are tutorials and sample projects rather than drop‑in horror libraries.youtube​
Example: A public Godot 4.2 dismemberment tutorial project demonstrates cutting limbs into separate rigid bodies and controlling them via skeleton/physical bones, using an open GitHub example repository rather than a packaged plugin.youtube​
For Cell, the pattern is:
Use open Godot dismemberment tutorial code (or similar MIT‑licensed snippets) as a reference and integrate into your own res://characters/dismemberment/ system.
Combine with CC0 gore textures and meshes from Itch CC0 horror packs to keep the asset side permissive.[itch+1](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0)​

How to attribute CC BY assets correctly
Creative Commons guidelines and developer discussions converge on a simple pattern: give visible credit with the required elements: author, title, license, and source link, and follow any custom instructions.[wiki.creativecommons+1](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/frequently_asked_questions)​
What CC BY expects (simplified)
Credit the creator (name or pseudonym).
Name the work (title or asset name).
Indicate the license version (e.g., “CC BY 4.0”).
Provide a URL to the source or license page when possible.[wiki.creativecommons](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/frequently_asked_questions)​
Practical in‑game implementation (based on dev discussions)
A credits screen listing each CC BY asset:
"Track: Spinal Corridor (c) 2023 Jane Doe – licensed under CC BY 4.0 – example.com/asset-link".[gimp-forum+1](https://www.gimp-forum.net/Thread-Licence-for-a-Game)​
A CREDITS.md or LICENSES.md file shipped with the game repeating the same information, plus URLs and any custom attribution text found on the asset page.[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/z0vk4/how_to_attribute_creative_commons_in_a_game/)​
Minimal data structure for Cell (to drive UI credits):
text

# File: res://meta/credits_registry.gd

extends Node
class_name CreditsRegistry

const CC_BY_ASSETS := [
{
"type": "music",
"title": "Spinal Corridor",
"author": "Jane Doe",
"license": "CC BY 4.0",
"source_url": "https://example.com/spinal-corridor"
},
{

"title": "Rust Door Hit",
"author": "John Smith",
"license": "CC BY 3.0",
"source_url": "https://example.com/rust-door-hit"
}
]

A credits scene can iterate over CC_BY_ASSETS and render a scrollable list, ensuring Cell remains compliant while using CC BY horror resources at scale.[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/z0vk4/how_to_attribute_creative_commons_in_a_game/)​

For Cell as a commercial horror game, treat CC0 and CC BY as “allowed by default” with a strict tracking/credits system, and isolate or avoid GPL/CC BY‑SA art unless you consciously accept share‑alike obligations. Below is a Cell‑ready legal pattern plus concrete Godot structures that enforce it at runtime and in tooling.[^3_1][^3_2]

## License policy for Cell

- **CC0**: Effectively public domain; you may use, modify, and sell these assets without attribution.[^3_3][^3_4]
    - Risk is mainly provenance: keep URLs and original pages logged for due‑diligence.
- **CC BY**: Safe for commercial use if you follow the attribution rules (author, title, license, source link).[^3_2][^3_1]
    - Practical pattern: in‑game credits + `CREDITS.md`/`LICENSES.md` listing each asset.
- **GPL / CC BY‑SA (art)**: Copyleft/share‑alike; discussions highlight ambiguity for closed‑source games, especially whether obligations spread beyond the asset to the whole project.[^3_1]
    - Keep these out of Cell’s main art/audio pool unless you are prepared to release derivatives of those specific assets (and clearly mark them as such), or to go fully open with compatible licensing.[^3_1]

For horror content, prefer CC0/CC BY assets from Itch and other hubs, and use GPL only for code modules where the entire codebase is architected to comply.

## Where to source CC0 horror bundles

- Itch CC0 horror tag: CC0 horror fantasy props, PSX‑style textures, haunted interiors, fonts, backgrounds, and often bundled ambience loops/SFX.[^3_3]
- Global CC0 index on Itch: low‑poly Halloween assets, skeletons, props, some with environmental audio.[^3_5]
- Combine with CC0 ambience like “Spooky Ambience” from Free‑Stock‑Music to get drones, noise beds, and environmental stingers.[^3_4]

Mirror these into `res://ASSETS/CC0/audio/` and `res://ASSETS/CC0/textures/`, keeping original URLs in a small text or JSON log for internal tracking.

## Pixel‑art horror tilesets in Godot

Use Itch’s Horror + Pixel Art tag for modern horror tilesets/sprites and the CC0 horror page for pixel‑friendly textures and tiles.[^3_6][^3_3]

**File:** `res://world/tiles/pixel_horror_tileset_loader.gd`

```gdscript
extends Node2D
class_name PixelHorrorTilesetLoader

@export var tilemap: TileMap
@export var tileset: TileSet
@export var license_tag := "CC0"  # "CC0" or "CC_BY" – for internal audit

func _ready() -> void:
    if not tilemap:
        push_warning("PixelHorrorTilesetLoader: tilemap not assigned.")
        return
    if not tileset:
        push_warning("PixelHorrorTilesetLoader: tileset not assigned.")
        return

    # Internal safety: only allow vetted tilesets (you enforce in import pipeline).
    if license_tag != "CC0" and license_tag != "CC_BY":
        push_error("PixelHorrorTilesetLoader: tileset has unsupported license_tag: %s" % license_tag)
        return

    tilemap.tile_set = tileset
```

Assign TileSets built from CC0 or CC BY horror packs (e.g., “Modern Horror Tiles!” or CC0 LSD‑inspired textures sliced into tiles).[^3_7][^3_3]

## Open‑source procedural gore for Cell

There is no turnkey, asset‑complete “EnGore‑style” plugin for Godot; available resources are mostly tutorials and example projects that show skeleton‑based dismemberment and physical limbs. The correct pattern for Cell:[^3_1]

- Use tutorial/example code (MIT/BSD compatible) as reference and re‑implement the logic inside `res://characters/dismemberment/` so Cell’s gore system is under Cell’s license.
- Feed it CC0 gore textures, meshes, and blood particles from Itch CC0 horror packs so asset licensing stays permissive.[^3_3]

**File:** `res://characters/dismemberment/dismemberment_controller.gd`

```gdscript
extends Node3D
class_name DismembermentController

@export var skeleton: Skeleton3D
@export var gore_chunk_scene: PackedScene    # CC0 limb/gore mesh
@export var blood_fx_scene: PackedScene      # CC0 blood particle scene

func cut_limb(bone_name: String, impulse: Vector3) -> void:
    if not skeleton:
        push_warning("DismembermentController: skeleton not assigned.")
        return

    var idx := skeleton.find_bone(bone_name)
    if idx == -1:
        push_warning("DismembermentController: bone '%s' not found." % bone_name)
        return

    var pose := skeleton.get_bone_global_pose(idx)

    # Collapse bone influence
    skeleton.set_bone_global_pose_override(
        idx,
        pose.scaled(Vector3(0.01, 0.01, 0.01)),
        1.0,
        true
    )

    # Spawn gore chunk
    if gore_chunk_scene:
        var chunk := gore_chunk_scene.instantiate()
        get_tree().current_scene.add_child(chunk)
        chunk.global_transform.origin = pose.origin
        if chunk is RigidBody3D:
            chunk.apply_impulse(Vector3.ZERO, impulse)

    # Spawn local blood spray
    if blood_fx_scene:
        var blood := blood_fx_scene.instantiate()
        add_child(blood)
        blood.global_transform.origin = pose.origin
```

All gore geometry, materials, and particles are from CC0/CC BY horror packs, so the procedural logic remains fully open while assets stay permissive.[^3_3]

## CC BY attribution system in Godot

Implement an explicit registry to drive both UI credits and the legal `CREDITS.md`, matching CC guidelines (author, work, license, link).[^3_2][^3_1]

**File:** `res://meta/credits_registry.gd`

```gdscript
extends Node
class_name CreditsRegistry

const CC_BY_ASSETS := [
    {
        "type": "music",
        "title": "Spinal Corridor",
        "author": "Jane Doe",
        "license": "CC BY 4.0",
        "source_url": "https://example.com/spinal-corridor"
    },
    {
        "type": "sfx",
        "title": "Rust Door Hit",
        "author": "John Smith",
        "license": "CC BY 3.0",
        "source_url": "https://example.com/rust-door-hit"
    }
]

static func get_assets_by_type(asset_type: String) -> Array:
    var out: Array = []
    for entry in CC_BY_ASSETS:
        if entry.get("type", "") == asset_type:
            out.append(entry)
    return out
```

A credits scene can iterate `CC_BY_ASSETS` to render a scrollable list, while a build‑time script can export the same data into `CREDITS.md`, keeping Cell compliant with CC BY obligations at scale.[^3_2]

## Simulated debug snapshot (legal + runtime)

```text
[Cell::LegalSnapshot]
ASSETS/CC0/...
  - spooky_facility_loop.ogg   (Itch CC0 horror ambience, URL logged) [OK: CC0]
  - lsd_corridor_tileset.tres  (Textures inspired by LSD-like CC0 pack) [OK: CC0]
ASSETS/CC_BY/...
  - spinal_corridor.ogg        (CC BY 4.0 – listed in CreditsRegistry) [OK: CC BY]
Forbidden zones:
  - No GPL/CC BY-SA textures or SFX in runtime dirs [ENFORCED BY REVIEW]

Runtime:
  PixelHorrorTilesetLoader: tileset_tag=CC0, tileset assigned.
  DismembermentController: using CC0 gore_chunk_scene + CC0 blood_fx_scene.
  CreditsRegistry: 2 CC BY assets registered, ready for UI + CREDITS.md export.
[/Cell::LegalSnapshot]
```

This structure keeps Cell’s horror pipeline legally clean, Godot‑native, and ready for automated tooling while still taking full advantage of CC0/CC BY horror repositories.

# For a commercial, horror‑focused Godot project like Cell, mixing CC0 and CC BY is safe if you keep licenses clearly separated and attributed, and you can optionally ask authors for more permissive terms when needed. Below is a concise, production‑oriented guide.[opengameart+1](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/best-practices-on-crediting-a-large-amount-of-assets)​

Combining CC0 and CC BY in one project
Keep assets physically separated and tagged
Use folder structure like: ASSETS/CC0/... and ASSETS/CC_BY/... with a LICENSES.md describing license, author, and source for every CC BY asset.[superpowers-html5+1](https://superpowers-html5.com/how-to-use-free-game-assets-legally-and-effectively/)​
This matches best‑practice guidance for managing large mixed sets (hundreds or thousands of assets) under CC0 and CC BY in a single game.[opengameart](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/best-practices-on-crediting-a-large-amount-of-assets)​
Treat CC0 as royalty‑free, CC BY as “needs credit”
CC0 assets can be modified, combined, and redistributed without attribution (though noting provenance internally is still recommended).[sceneri](https://www.sceneri.com/blog_post/creative-commons-and-licensing/)​
CC BY assets can be mixed freely with CC0, as long as each CC BY item receives attribution as the creator requires (credits screen + text file).[code.tutsplus+1](https://code.tutsplus.com/understanding-licenses-or-can-i-use-this-asset-in-my-game--cms-22510a)​
Avoid mixing in NC / ND / SA unless intentional
Guides on mixed sources stress that NC (non‑commercial), ND (no derivatives), and SA (share‑alike) clauses complicate commercial and closed‑source releases and should be avoided for core assets.[scp-wiki.wikidot+1](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/guide-to-mixed-sources)​

Steps to request a relicense from an author
When an asset is under a license you dislike (e.g., CC BY‑SA, GPL, NC), you can ask the author for additional permission or a different license.[opengameart+1](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/cc-by-sa-for-commercial-games)​
Identify the asset and current license precisely
Note asset name, current license (e.g., “CC BY‑SA 4.0”), download URL, and how you plan to use it (e.g., “2D tileset in a commercial horror game”).[opengameart](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/cc-by-sa-for-commercial-games)​
Decide what you want to ask for
Typical requests:
Additional permission for commercial use with no share‑alike.
Dual‑licensing under CC BY or even CC0 for your project.[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/o9sdr5/which_license_to_request_an_asset_creator_to_use/)​
Contact via written, durable channel
Use email, platform messaging with exportable history, or even a signed PDF; OpenGameArt guidance suggests having a clear written record if terms are changed.[opengameart](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/cc-by-sa-for-commercial-games)​
Phrase the request clearly and respectfully
Example pattern from licensing discussions: briefly explain your game, how the asset will appear, what license you’re asking for, and that you will still credit the author prominently.[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/o9sdr5/which_license_to_request_an_asset_creator_to_use/)​
Store proof with your project
Save the email/thread or a signed permission note inside META/legal/asset_permissions/ in your repository so you can demonstrate consent if there is ever a dispute.[opengameart](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/cc-by-sa-for-commercial-games)​

Safe CC0 horror bundles with SFX included
Itch.io – CC0 horror asset index
The Itch CC0 horror page lists 70+ CC0 horror resources, including:
“Half‑Life 2 inspired OST, Ambiences \& SFX”
“CC‑0 Horror Fantasy Assets”
CC0 horror interiors, 64×64 wall/floor textures and a “sketchy, horror‑ish 9px script font.”[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​
These are explicitly CC0, meaning you can bundle, modify, and resell them as part of your game with no attribution requirement.[itch+1](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​
General CC0 asset index (for horror‑adjacent packs)
The broader Itch CC0 asset listing includes low‑poly Halloween sets, skeletons, and environment props often designed “for modern engines, free to use for any purpose!” under CC0.[sceneri+1](https://www.sceneri.com/blog_post/creative-commons-and-licensing/)​
These may contain SFX or ambient loops bundled with 3D or 2D asset packs, all under CC0.
For Cell, mirror chosen packs into ASSETS/CC0/audio/ and ASSETS/CC0/visual/, log each in META/LICENSES.md, and treat them as safe “base materials” for heavy processing.

Top pixel‑art horror tilesets and Godot import tips (2D)
Itch.io – Horror + Pixel Art tag
The “Horror + Pixel Art” asset tag on Itch lists specialized pixel‑art horror tilesets and sprites (e.g., modern horror interiors, RPG sprites, UI elements) created for 2D engines.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/tag-horror/tag-pixel-art)​
Many packs mention tile sizes (often 16×16, 32×32 or 48×48) and compatibility notes, which map cleanly to Godot’s TileMap and TileSet workflow.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/tag-horror/tag-pixel-art)​
Itch.io – CC0 horror assets (pixel‑compatible textures)
The Itch CC0 horror page includes 64×64 wall/floor/light textures and PSX/retro‑style sets inspired by LSD‑like surreal games; although “3D/texture” oriented, they work well as tile sources for 2D.[itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror)​
These can be downsampled or sliced to 16×16 or 32×32 tiles and imported into Godot with pixel‑perfect settings.
Core Godot import settings for crisp 2D horror tiles:
In the Import dock for the tileset PNG:
Set Filter = Off, Mipmaps = Off, Anisotropic = Off to avoid blurring.
Set Repeat = Enabled for walls/floors that may tile seamlessly.
Enable Pixel Snap in project settings for consistent grid alignment.
In the TileSet resource:
Use the correct tile size (16×16, 32×32, etc.) to match the source pack; community guidance emphasizes matching tileset grid to the actual tile resolution to avoid misalignment.[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gbstudio/comments/1f9jw5o/using_tilesetssprites_from_itchio_import_help_i/)​
A minimal loader for Cell:
text

# File: res://world/tiles/pixel_horror_tileset_loader.gd

extends Node2D

@export var tilemap: TileMap
@export var tileset: TileSet

func _ready() -> void:
if tilemap and tileset:
tilemap.tile_set = tileset

Attach this to a level scene, assign a TileMap and a TileSet created from one of the Itch horror pixel packs; the import settings above ensure the result looks sharp and horror‑authentic.[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gbstudio/comments/1f9jw5o/using_tilesetssprites_from_itchio_import_help_i/)​

Attribution pattern for mixed CC0 + CC BY assets
Best‑practice threads for large mixed libraries recommend centralizing credits so you can safely mix CC0 and CC BY resources.[superpowers-html5+1](https://superpowers-html5.com/how-to-use-free-game-assets-legally-and-effectively/)​
Attribution content
For each CC BY asset, record:
Title of the work.
Author name/pseudonym.
License (e.g., “CC BY 4.0”).
Source URL.[code.tutsplus](https://code.tutsplus.com/understanding-licenses-or-can-i-use-this-asset-in-my-game--cms-22510a)​
Where to show it
An in‑game credits section listing all non‑CC0 assets and a shipped CREDITS.md/LICENSES.md file are common solutions for games with 2000+ assets from CC0 and CC BY sources.[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/z0vk4/how_to_attribute_creative_commons_in_a_game/)​
This approach lets Cell freely combine strong CC0 horror bundles with higher‑profile CC BY packs while staying legally clean and respectful.

CC0 and CC BY can coexist safely in Cell if the repository is structured to reflect license boundaries, attribution is driven by data, and “off‑license” assets (SA/NC/ND/GPL) are either excluded or explicitly relicensed. Below is a minimal, production‑ready pattern wired directly into Godot.[^4_1][^4_2]

## Repository layout and tags

- `res://ASSETS/CC0/...` – only assets verified as CC0 (e.g., Itch CC0 horror bundles, CC0 OSTs/SFX).[^4_2]
- `res://ASSETS/CC_BY/...` – only assets verified as CC BY or similar attribution‑only terms.[^4_1]
- `res://META/LICENSES.md` – table listing each CC BY asset: title, author, license, URL, internal path.[^4_1]
- `res://META/legal/asset_permissions/` – stored emails/notes when authors grant special terms (e.g., relicense from CC BY‑SA to CC BY).[^4_3]

This mirrors best‑practice guidance for large mixed CC0/CC BY sets in commercial games.[^4_3][^4_1]

## Godot license‑aware asset registry

**File:** `res://meta/license_aware_asset_registry.gd`

```gdscript
extends Node
class_name LicenseAwareAssetRegistry

# Logical groups for runtime usage
const ASSETS := {
    "audio_spooky_loop": {
        "path": "res://ASSETS/CC0/audio/spooky_facility_loop.ogg",
        "license": "CC0"
    },
    "tileset_psx_corridor": {
        "path": "res://ASSETS/CC0/tilesets/psx_corridor.tres",
        "license": "CC0"
    },
    "music_spinal_corridor": {
        "path": "res://ASSETS/CC_BY/music/spinal_corridor.ogg",
        "license": "CC BY 4.0"
    }
}

static func get_asset(id: String) -> Resource:
    if not ASSETS.has(id):
        push_warning("LicenseAwareAssetRegistry: asset id '%s' not registered." % id)
        return null

    var info := ASSETS[id]
    var path: String = info.get("path", "")
    var license: String = info.get("license", "UNKNOWN")

    # Safety: reject assets tagged with unsupported licenses at runtime
    if license.begins_with("CC BY-NC") or license.find("SA") != -1 or license == "GPL":
        push_error("Asset '%s' has unsupported license '%s'." % [id, license])
        return null

    if not ResourceLoader.exists(path):
        push_warning("Asset '%s' path '%s' missing on disk." % [id, path])
        return null

    return load(path)

static func get_license(id: String) -> String:
    return ASSETS.get(id, {}).get("license", "UNKNOWN")
```

Cell’s gameplay code loads through `LicenseAwareAssetRegistry.get_asset()` so unsupported licenses (NC/ND/SA/GPL) cannot silently enter the shipping build.[^4_3][^4_1]

## Pixel‑horror tileset import and loading

Use horror + pixel‑art packs from Itch for tiles/sprites, and CC0 horror textures as 2D tile sources.[^4_4][^4_2]

Import tips (per pack and engine guides):

- In the PNG import panel: Filter = Off, Mipmaps = Off, Anisotropic = Off for crisp pixel art.
- Set Repeat = Enabled for seamless walls/floors, and ensure tile size matches the pack’s documented grid (e.g., 32×32).[^4_4]

**File:** `res://world/tiles/pixel_horror_tileset_loader.gd`

```gdscript
extends Node2D
class_name PixelHorrorTilesetLoader

@export var tilemap: TileMap
@export var asset_id := "tileset_psx_corridor"  # key in LicenseAwareAssetRegistry

func _ready() -> void:
    if not tilemap:
        push_warning("PixelHorrorTilesetLoader: tilemap not assigned.")
        return

    var ts_res := LicenseAwareAssetRegistry.get_asset(asset_id)
    if ts_res == null or not (ts_res is TileSet):
        push_warning("PixelHorrorTilesetLoader: asset '%s' is not a valid TileSet." % asset_id)
        return

    tilemap.tile_set = ts_res
```

This keeps tileset usage aligned with the registry and ensures only vetted CC0/CC BY tile resources get bound.[^4_2][^4_4]

## Credits system for CC BY assets

**File:** `res://meta/credits_registry.gd`

```gdscript
extends Node
class_name CreditsRegistry

const CC_BY_ASSETS := [
    {
        "type": "music",
        "title": "Spinal Corridor",
        "author": "Jane Doe",
        "license": "CC BY 4.0",
        "source_url": "https://example.com/spinal-corridor"
    },
    {
        "type": "tileset",
        "title": "Modern Horror Tiles!",
        "author": "Alice Artist",
        "license": "CC BY 3.0",
        "source_url": "https://itch.io/example-modern-horror-tiles"
    }
]

static func all_entries() -> Array:
    return CC_BY_ASSETS.duplicate()

static func entries_by_type(t: String) -> Array:
    var out: Array = []
    for e in CC_BY_ASSETS:
        if e.get("type", "") == t:
            out.append(e)
    return out
```

An in‑game credits scene and a build script can both iterate this array to generate UI text and `META/CREDITS.md`, matching common CC BY attribution patterns for large mixed libraries.[^4_1]

## Request‑and‑store relicense flow

For assets under unwanted terms (CC BY‑SA, NC, ND, GPL), Cell’s process:

- Identify: record asset name, URL, current license, and intended use (e.g., “blood tiles in commercial horror game”).[^4_3]
- Request: contact the author asking for CC BY or CC0 for Cell (or explicit commercial permission), via durable channels (email, platform messages).[^4_3]
- Store: save the email/PDF in `res://META/legal/asset_permissions/<asset_id>.txt` so future maintainers can prove the exception.[^4_3]

This lets Cell adopt otherwise problematic horror assets only when clear, written permission exists.

## Simulated internal/legal debug snapshot

```text
[Cell::LicenseSnapshot]
Registry:
  audio_spooky_loop        -> CC0  (Itch CC0 horror ambience pack) [OK]
  tileset_psx_corridor     -> CC0  (Itch CC0 PSX textures sliced to TileSet) [OK]
  music_spinal_corridor    -> CC BY 4.0 (credits entry present) [OK]

Runtime checks:
  PixelHorrorTilesetLoader(asset_id="tileset_psx_corridor")
    -> TileSet loaded, license = CC0
  CreditsRegistry
    -> 2 CC BY assets registered for UI + CREDITS.md export

Forbidden:
  No NC / ND / SA / GPL assets in ASSETS/CC0 or ASSETS/CC_BY.
  Any future ASSETS/* entry with license_tag in {NC, ND, SA, GPL}
    -> blocked by LicenseAwareAssetRegistry.get_asset().
[/Cell::LicenseSnapshot]
```

This pattern lets Cell aggressively mine CC0 horror bundles and high‑quality CC BY packs while keeping license boundaries visible to both humans and tooling.

# For a commercial horror game like Cell, mixed‑license documentation and extra permissions should be handled as part of your build pipeline and repository, with clear written proof for anything non‑standard. Below are concise answers to each point with patterns you can drop into your workflow.

Documenting mixed license attributions
For a project with CC0, CC BY, and possibly CC BY‑SA/GPL pieces, public documentation should explicitly map which files use which license.[lazerwalker+1](https://blog.lazerwalker.com/2022/06/14/oss-licensing-for-art.html)​
Maintain a top‑level LICENSE for your game code and original content, and a separate LICENSES.md / CREDITS.md describing third‑party assets.[lazerwalker](https://blog.lazerwalker.com/2022/06/14/oss-licensing-for-art.html)​
In LICENSES.md, group entries like:
“All code in /src under MIT (your license).”
“All art in /ASSETS/CC0 under CC0 (see per‑folder notes).”
“The following assets in /ASSETS/CC_BY/ under CC BY 4.0, with full attribution lines and URLs.”[opengameart+1](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/best-practices-on-crediting-a-large-amount-of-assets)​
Mixed‑source guidance emphasizes making it clear which parts are open licensed and which are all‑rights‑reserved, rather than pretending the whole project shares one license.[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/105yl4r/if_you_want_your_game_to_be_open_creative_commons/)​

CC BY assets inside a DRM‑protected executable
Creative Commons licenses allow commercial use and do not directly forbid bundling with DRM, but the copyleft/SA variants require that DRM not be the only way to access the CC‑licensed content.[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dcke42/is_it_possible_to_use_ccbysa_assets_for_a/)​
Community legal discussions about CC BY‑SA in commercial games on DRM platforms (e.g., Steam) suggest:
You may ship CC BY / CC BY‑SA art inside an executable, provided users can obtain those assets without DRM somewhere else (e.g., a separate download or repo).[info.arxiv+1](https://info.arxiv.org/help/license/index.html)​
Forpure CC BY (no SA), there is no share‑alike/DRM clause; you just must give proper attribution and not add extra restrictions to the asset beyond the license terms.[wiki.creativecommons+1](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/frequently_asked_questions)​
Practically for Cell, you can:
Include CC BY textures and audio inside the build.
Provide an accessible list and, if using SA content, a non‑DRM copy of the modified SA assets (see below).

Template: asking an artist to relicense for commercial use
Developers commonly ask asset authors to dual‑license or grant extra permissions (e.g., from CC BY‑SA/NC to CC BY or custom commercial license).[lpc.opengameart+1](https://lpc.opengameart.org/forumtopic/licensing-question)​
Minimal email outline (adapt the bracketed parts):
Subject: Request to use AssetNameAsset NameAssetName in a commercial game (license clarification)
Hello ArtistNameArtist NameArtistName,
I’m a developer working on a commercial horror game called “Cell”. I would like to use your asset “AssetNameAsset NameAssetName”, currently released under CurrentLicense,e.g.,CCBY‑SA4.0/CCBY‑NCCurrent License, e.g., CC BY‑SA 4.0 / CC BY‑NCCurrentLicense,e.g.,CCBY‑SA4.0/CCBY‑NC, as part of the game’s briefusage:e.g.,environmenttileset/UI/soundeffectsbrief usage: e.g., environment tileset / UI / sound effectsbriefusage:e.g.,environmenttileset/UI/soundeffects.
To keep our licensing consistent, I would like to ask if you are willing to grant us an additional license to use this asset under requestedterms,e.g.,CCBY4.0/CC0/anon‑exclusivecommerciallicensewithoutshare‑alikerestrictionsrequested terms, e.g., CC BY 4.0 / CC0 / a non‑exclusive commercial license without share‑alike restrictionsrequestedterms,e.g.,CCBY4.0/CC0/anon‑exclusivecommerciallicensewithoutshare‑alikerestrictions. We will still credit you in the game and in our documentation as:
“YourpreferredattributionlineYour preferred attribution lineYourpreferredattributionline”.
If you agree, please confirm in writing (and, if possible, restate the new license terms you are granting) so we can retain your permission with our project records.
Thank you for your time,

OpenGameArt discussions emphasize that authors are free to release their own work under multiple licenses simultaneously (e.g., CC0 here, GPL there), so dual‑licensing for a specific project is normal.[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/o9sdr5/which_license_to_request_an_asset_creator_to_use/)​

Proof of permission to keep for relicensed assets
From copyright due‑diligence guidance and licensing Q\&A, you should keep a clear chain of title: documentation that shows who owns what and what permissions were granted.[maccelerator+1](https://maccelerator.la/en/blog/entrepreneurship/copyright-due-diligence-checklist/)​
Store:
A copy of the original asset page (PDF or HTML snapshot).
The author’s written consent (email export, signed PDF, DM screenshot with visible date and handle).[maccelerator](https://maccelerator.la/en/blog/entrepreneurship/copyright-due-diligence-checklist/)​
Any explicit license text they granted (e.g., “I grant StudioStudioStudio the right to use AssetNameAsset NameAssetName under CC BY 4.0 for commercial games.”).[lpc.opengameart+1](https://lpc.opengameart.org/forumtopic/licensing-question)​
Keep these in a versioned folder like META/legal/third_party_permissions/, referenced in your internal legal checklist.[maccelerator](https://maccelerator.la/en/blog/entrepreneurship/copyright-due-diligence-checklist/)​
Due‑diligence checklists recommend preserving such documents with project records in case of future audits or disputes.[maccelerator](https://maccelerator.la/en/blog/entrepreneurship/copyright-due-diligence-checklist/)​

Hosting CC BY / SA assets to comply with terms
If you use CC BY‑SA (or other SA variants), share‑alike requires that modified versions be available under the same license; discussions around CC‑SA in games plus the CC documentation itself recommend hosting accessible copies outside DRM.[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dcke42/is_it_possible_to_use_ccbysa_assets_for_a/)​
Where to host:
Public Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab) with a clear directory for CC BY / CC BY‑SA assets and a LICENSE file specifying CC BY/SA terms.[info.arxiv+1](https://info.arxiv.org/help/license/index.html)​
Your own website/CDN or itch.io project page that offers a zip of the CC BY‑SA art with a clear license notice.[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dcke42/is_it_possible_to_use_ccbysa_assets_for_a/)​
How to reference:
In your game credits / LICENSES.md, link to the hosted location:
“Modified CC BY‑SA 4.0 tiles by AuthorAuthorAuthor available at: URLURLURL, under CC BY‑SA 4.0.”[info.arxiv+1](https://info.arxiv.org/help/license/index.html)​
Community answers about CC BY‑SA + DRM note that DRM is less problematic if the CC‑licensed assets are also available separately without DRM and clearly labeled with their license.[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dcke42/is_it_possible_to_use_ccbysa_assets_for_a/)​
For Cell, a practical pattern is: host all CC BY / CC BY‑SA art in a public repo or static page with full license text, link that from in‑game credits, and keep all relicensing emails and snapshots in your META/legal directory.

Cell should treat licensing as part of the engine architecture: the repo, build, and UI all “know” which assets are CC0, CC BY, or specially permitted, and can prove it later. Below are directly usable structures.[^5_1][^5_2]

## Mixed-license docs in the repo

Have two public documents and a legal archive.[^5_3][^5_1]

- `LICENSE` – Cell’s own license (code, original art).
- `LICENSES.md` – third‑party summary, e.g.:
    - “All code in `/src` under MIT.”
    - “All assets in `/ASSETS/CC0` under CC0 (per‑pack notes in subfolders).”
    - “The following assets in `/ASSETS/CC_BY` under CC BY 3.0 / 4.0 with attribution lines and URLs.”[^5_1][^5_3]
- `META/legal/third_party_permissions/` – stored emails/PDFs for any relicensing or extra permissions, plus HTML/PDF snapshots of original pages.

This matches best‑practice guidance to clearly separate your game’s license from third‑party licenses.[^5_3][^5_1]

## Godot: central license map for assets

**File:** `res://meta/license_map.gd`

```gdscript
extends Node
class_name LicenseMap

const ENTRIES := [
    {
        "id": "tileset_psx_corridor",
        "path": "res://ASSETS/CC0/tilesets/psx_corridor.tres",
        "license": "CC0",
        "source": "https://itch.io/game-assets/assets-cc0/tag-horror"
    },
    {
        "id": "music_spinal_corridor",
        "path": "res://ASSETS/CC_BY/music/spinal_corridor.ogg",
        "license": "CC BY 4.0",
        "source": "https://example.com/spinal-corridor"
    }
]

static func get_entry(id: String) -> Dictionary:
    for e in ENTRIES:
        if e.get("id", "") == id:
            return e
    return {}

static func safe_load(id: String) -> Resource:
    var e := get_entry(id)
    if e.is_empty():
        push_warning("LicenseMap: unknown asset id '%s'." % id)
        return null

    var lic := e.get("license", "UNKNOWN")
    if lic.find("NC") != -1 or lic.find("ND") != -1 or lic.find("SA") != -1 or lic == "GPL":
        push_error("LicenseMap: asset '%s' has unsupported license '%s'." % [id, lic])
        return null

    var path := e.get("path", "")
    if not ResourceLoader.exists(path):
        push_warning("LicenseMap: missing resource '%s'." % path)
        return null

    return load(path)
```

All runtime loading (tilesets, SFX, music) goes through `LicenseMap.safe_load`, so NC/ND/SA/GPL never ship by accident.[^5_1][^5_3]

## CC BY inside a DRM build (and SA hosting)

For plain CC BY assets, bundling inside a DRM‑protected executable is acceptable as long as you still provide proper attribution and do not add extra restrictions beyond the license. For CC BY‑SA, community advice and CC guidance favor also hosting the SA assets (and your modifications) outside DRM:

- Host modified CC BY‑SA art in a public repo or on your site/itch page, with a clear “CC BY‑SA 4.0” notice.
- In `LICENSES.md` and in‑game credits, link to that location for each SA asset.

For Cell, simplest rule: core assets = CC0/CC BY; CC BY‑SA only in clearly labeled optional packs with public hosting.

## Tracking CC BY credits in Godot/UI

**File:** `res://meta/credits_registry.gd`

```gdscript
extends Node
class_name CreditsRegistry

const CC_BY := [
    {
        "type": "music",
        "title": "Spinal Corridor",
        "author": "Jane Doe",
        "license": "CC BY 4.0",
        "url": "https://example.com/spinal-corridor"
    }
]

static func all() -> Array:
    return CC_BY.duplicate()
```

A credits scene can iterate `CreditsRegistry.all()` to render:

> “Music: ‘Spinal Corridor’ by Jane Doe – CC BY 4.0 – https://example.com/spinal-corridor”

and a build‑time script can turn the same data into part of `LICENSES.md`, matching CC expectations.[^5_1]

## Storing relicensing proof

Follow due‑diligence checklists: keep proof of any special license promises.

Repository convention:

- `META/legal/third_party_permissions/asset_<id>.md`:
    - original asset URL
    - original license
    - date of agreement
    - pasted email or message text with the author granting additional/alternate license (e.g., “You may use this under CC BY 4.0 in commercial games”).

These files are version‑controlled alongside code, giving Cell a clear chain of title if the game is audited later.

## Simulated Cell build snapshot

```text
[Cell::LegalBuildSnapshot]
LICENSE: core code + original art under MIT / proprietary (per file).
LICENSES.md:
  /ASSETS/CC0 -> CC0 (Itch CC0 horror + in-house CC0 releases).
  /ASSETS/CC_BY -> CC BY 3.0 / 4.0, attributed via CreditsRegistry.
  /ASSETS/experimental/SA -> CC BY-SA 4.0, mirrored at public repo URL.

Runtime:
  LicenseMap.safe_load(...) blocks NC/ND/SA/GPL-tagged entries.
  CreditsRegistry drives in-game credits + LICENSES.md generation.

Archive:
  META/legal/third_party_permissions/*
    -> emails/PDFs for all relicensed or specially permitted assets.

Status: ready for commercial distribution on DRM platforms with clear, verifiable licensing boundaries.
